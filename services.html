				<h3>Stamp-work (<a href="decorative.html">Decorative Concrete</a>)</h3>
				<p>Black's Concrete Construction takes pride in using the finest of materials in order 
				to get the job done just perfectly. This includes products from the likes of <a href="https://www.butterfieldcolor.com/">Butterfield Color
			    &reg;&#44;</a> in order to get stamped concrete to look as realistic as possible. We incorporate
				Butterfield coloring powders to color and accent concrete products accordingly.</p>

				<h3><a href="flatwork.html">Flat-work</a></h3>
				<p>We take care of everything from driveways, patios, flooring, and poll-barns. We have the tools in order
				to see any project through to the end. And even if we don't have the tool for the job at hand, we can special
				order it just in time to get the project done.</p>
				<p>In the case that you want a coarse floor, there are two methods that
				we can manipulate in order to get the desired effect. The first method would be using a brush in order to create
				fine lines within the concrete so that it allows for a good grip. This is common on driveways and stairs, 
				as they tend to need this so that vehicles can hold traction in the winter months. The other method we can 
				use is to add a type of sand to our sealer in order to allow for a bit of a grip. This method would be ideal 
				for garage floors, barn floors, etc. Anywhere that requires a slick finish. </p>
				
				<h3>Concrete Repair</h3>
				<p>We also like to take it light sometimes and do some easy work. This would include the likes of 
				repairing spalding concrete&#44; cracks&#44; or just adding a layer altogether. Usually applying a thin layer 
				of concrete doesn't mean that you'll need a truck-full in order to get the job done. These jobs can be 
				done with a bag of concrete&#44; a five gallon bucket&#44; and a couple of trowels.</p>
				<figure>	
					<img class="mini" src="images/mini-excavator.jpeg" width="250" height="250" alt="Bobcat Mini-Excavator&#44; similar to that of the one BCC rents occasionally.">
				</figure> 
				<p>Or&#44; we can likely tear out existing concrete in which doesn't do the job anymore. We have the tools
				to get the job done. Albeit a sledgehammer&#44; jackhammer&#44; or a Bobcat. All deconstruction jobs are handle 
				with care. We'll even take the concrete with us when we go.</p>
				
				
				<h3>Light Excavation</h3>
				<p>Sometimes the ground in which we work on isn't quite to spec. This means that either we have 
				to level it ourselves, or hire a company, <a href="http://www.careyexcavating.com/">Carey Excavating</a>, 
				in order to get it to where it's supposed to be. There are a few methods we use in order to make 
				sure that our work-site is level. This could include hauling in pea-gravel, or removing a layer 
				of dirt. While we have a Bobcat, excavating for a foundation, or footer, isn't feasible with that 
				sort of technology. It'd take way too much time.</p>
				
				<h3>Resurfacing</h3>
				<p>We can also add a thin-layer of concrete to existing concrete. Usually to do this, we simply 
				use bags, instead of a truck, as we want concrete that's got more of a sand texture, rather than 
				rocky. Going into a project where we add a layer, we usually have to use a grinder to rough up 
				the surface a bit, to get the new stuff to stick better. To further aide in this, we add a 
				substance similar to that of Elmer's glue to prime the surface. Finally we lay the concrete 
				and float it out. These projects usually are quite quick, as they aren't as thick as doing a 
				four inch slab of concrete.</p>
				<p>We can even stamp this type of concrete to further suite the customer!</p>

				<p class="thin-layer">Just because it's a thin layer doesn't mean it can't be aesthetically pleasing. The picture 
				above, shows a front porch step in which this method was used. The steps at the top of the picture 
				are actual brick. The lining below that, in which encases the patio, is actually made of concrete.
				This was done with paint brushes and a type of concrete paint. This paint is comparable to what 
				we use for accenting stamped jobs.

					<img class="blanket" src="images/blanket-roller.jpg" width="500" height="250" alt="A Blanket Roller, used for rolling up concrete blankets">
					<p class="blcaption">Within the picture above, is one of our blankets, being rolled up using 
					the <a href="http://www.pcultimatetradesman.com/blanketroller.html">BlanketRoller</a>, from 
					<a href="http://www.pcultimatetradesman.com/">Tradesman Tools</a>. We took quite a liking 
					to this simple to use tool, as it allows for us to wrap blankets up into a compact roll, and 
					allows for storing them better.</p>
				</figure>
				<p>During the winter months we can cover the ground or concrete itself with our thermal blankets. 
				Allowing us to have stave off freezing altogether. Blankets help us in case we need to re-level 
				the ground prior to pouring anything, in case any dirt feel in.</p>
