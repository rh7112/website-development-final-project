				<h2>Black's Concrete Construction Website Report</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Black's Concrete Construction</li>
					<li>While I only expect to use this site for this project, I hope that it informs people as to a local Indiana concrete company. The owner of the business likely has no idea that I've fabricated this site, and probably wouldn't appreciate having a website, but nonetheless, provides a good topic to be covered.</li>
					<li>My target audience would have to be those who live around the lakes in Kosciusko county, Indiana. Other members of my audience would include homeowners looking to have concrete done on their property. Albeit weather they have internet experience or not.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h2>Problem Exploration</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Client Questions</li>
					<p>"Is the layout simple enough for the target audience?"</p>
					<p>Client - "I don't understand any of that stuff! Leave me out of it!"</p>
					<p>or</p>
					<p>Client - "Looks good to me!"
					<br><br><br>
					<p>"Are you okay with your phone number being posted on the site?"</p>
					<p>Client - "No, I don't want people calling me all the time."</p>
					<p>"Alright I'll remove it."
					<br><br><br>
					<p>""</p>
					<p>""</p>
					<li>Benchamrks for site being "succesfull"</li>
					<p>Benchmarks to determine if the site is successfull, could be things like monitoring how many people are visitng the site within a given period of time. As well, see how many people are filling out the information within the "contact us" page.</p>
					<li>Issues</li>
					<p>Just like accessing any website, if the user has insufficient bandwidth, they'll likely be thrown through a loop when it comes to accessing the site.</p>
					<p>Just as well, having a really out of date s system may effect the experience on the user's end.</p>
					<li>Scope of the Website</li>
					<p>Number of pages: 8 (not including this page)</p>
					<ol>
						<li>index.html</li>
						<li>about.html</li>
						<li>decorative.html</li>
						<li>flatwork.html</li>
						<li>services.html</li>
						<li>gallery.html</li>
						<li>contact.html</li>
						<li>results.html</li>
					</ol>
					<br>
					<p>The complexity of the pages isn't too complex. On some pages, there are two columns, others are just one column.</p>
					<p>Forms of multimedia include the likes of social media pictures, feeds, videos, etc. Regular pictures and videos as well.</p>
					<li>Assumptions and areas to be changed</li>
					<p>Not applicable, although if it were, it would need to be changed in areas to make it more visually appealing.</p>
					<li>Site accesibility needs and implementation must be included</li>
					<p>The site is accesible enough, although it could use a few more features in order to make it even better.</p>
				</ol>

				<h2>Information Architecture, Organization, and Design</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>The site genre fits under a construction business type. The background image for this site is a common concrete material, to reflect the subject at hand. I've had problems in designing the layout for images. As well, wrapping content around the images, although I gradually figured this out by using margins/padding.</li>
					<li>As far as the topology goes, I obviously put the home page first in line, with the About-Us second. The middle selections: Decorative, Flat-work, and services found their spot as to to be in the center of where the user will be looking. Followed by the Gallery and Contact us page.</li>
					<li>My template was not of sufficient design or length, so I would consider this not applicable.</li>
<!--					<li>Mention competeing ideas that you had to resolve</li> -->
				</ol>
				
				<h2>Testing, Maintenance, and Promotion Plan</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>I had both of my sisters review my site. As they are the only people I know with iPhone's. Their reactions were of surprise, but after the novelty wore off, they both provided insight that my table had been a little off kilter. As well, I had a few friends from Discord look at the site, they found the site to be of "sufficient" design after reviewing it.</li>
					<li>If this site were to go live, I would likely be the one to maintain it. As the owner of the business is not very tech savvy, being as he's been in the construction business a majority of his life. I would likely update the site every few months, with more images, as to show the vastness of the jobs that are completed. The only issues I would run into when implementing new things to the site would be rearranging everything to fit properly.</li>
					<li>I would consider advertising to be not applicable. As this is a small business that is usually quite behind on projects. Having people call all the time when you're in the middle of a job is quite frustrating. While I suppose if it were to be advertised, it'd be light. The business more or less operates on a first come, first serve basis, so advertising and promotion isn't a big factor.</li>

				<h2>Implementation and Reflection</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Bibliography</li>
					<p>Prior to graduating high school with an academic honors diploma, I decided I'd work for the owner of the business, Don. He's been my dad's best friend since they met in elementary school, so I've known him my whole life. He was quite accepting of teaching me what I didn't want to do for the rest of my life. I worked for him for about 7 months.</p>
					<li>References</li>
					<p>Within my site I included links to the likes of Keurt's Concrete, Butterfield Color, and Carey Excavation.</p>
					<p>Most of my images came from my cellphone, as I liked to take pictures of completed jobsites. There were about four images that were not mine. These images included the likes of the saw image on the "about-us" page, the stamp pattern and mini-excavator images on "services." I found a majority of these images on google images.</p>
					<li>I'm not quite sure I understand the question when it asks for the difference between the "big picture" and implementation.</li>
					<p>But to elaborate on what I assume this may believe, it's difficult to bring the insight of a business, unto such a small platform. A businesses reputation has a lot to live up to, but can encompass a vass category. Making it hard to encapsulate just exactly what the "customer" would like their site to look like. Even when it comes to something as black and white as concrete construction, it's difficult to lay down the ideas of that company thoroughly.</p>
					<li>My "customer" doesn't know that I even made a website for him. So I wouldn't quite consider him a client or customer. I was able to meet the project requirements quite easily. I enjoyed taking on this project, although frightenign at first. I didn't beleive I'd get a website as developed as what I've gotten within this semester.</li>
					<p>The "hard choices" for my site came within the design mostly. Things like what I wanted the color to be, or how to have the layout look.</p>
					<li>While I worked in the field, I didn't have to do too much research. Although I looked at bigger, more industrial concrete compnanies, I couldn't find much that appeased me. I spent alot of time looking into other companies sites, when I didn't use any ideas from them.</li>
					<p>So I would say I probably have a problem with getting sidetracked, rather than research. 
					<li>I likely won't be making many changes or improvements on this site within the future, as I have no need to. Unless the owner actually asked for me to release it. Upon which, I would than further go into making the lay-out more fluid than what it is. I would also ask him what he'd like me to do with the base that I've got, and if he'd like any changes, and throw them in as I change the site up.</li>
