				<h2>Just like the concrete we pour&#44; we&#39;re here to stay</h2>
				<p>We strive to bring the best looking concrete to your front&#44; or back doorstep. 
				But we don&#39;t stop there. Even after hand-raking 10 yards of concrete&#44; we&#39;ll sit there 
				and keep an eye on it until it&#39;s good and dry. Ensuring that it&#39;s just perfect. From 
				every corner&#44; edge&#44; to the very face of the concrete itself.</p>
				
				<h2>Weather you want it repaired or ripped out!</h2>

				</figure>
				<p class="spall-text">We'll take special care of your concrete weather it's a basement wall, to simple patio. Weather you
				want a fresh slate, or to keep the exisiting stuff. Spalling (minor cracks due to shifting) concrete just needs a little love in order 
				to get it to look proper again! Sometimes all you need is a fresh coat of sealer, instead of a brand new
				walk-way. Albeit, we won't talk you out of it!
				
				<h2 class="flats">Need <a href="flatwork.html">flat-work</a> done?</h2>
				<p>Bought some land you&#39;d like to break ground on? We&#39;ll set it to completion. 
				Everything from the basement floor&#44; foundation&#44; up to the garage floor&#44; sidewalks&#44; and 
				driveways! We have the right tools in order to make sure that your basement or garage 
				floor will have a nice slick look to it&#44; but give all the traction one may ever need.</p>
				
				<p>We&#39;ve done various commercial projects that have involved flat surfaces. Including 
				redoing a good majority of the sidewalk for <a href="https://www.elkhartchristian.org/">
				Elkhart Christian Academy</a>.</p>
				
				<p>In South Bend&#44; we handled the flooring for an addition 
				<a href="http://www.natconusa.com/">NATCON</a> (National Consolidated Corp.) wanted to 
				add to their building. Within three weeks we had the job ready for the other contractors 
				to come in throw up walls and everything else.</p>
				
				<p>We also took care of handling <a href="http://www.davidsenspierservice.com/">Davidsen&#39;s 
				Pier service&#39;s</a> new location&#44; located in North Webster right on the corner of 
				state-road 13 and Armstrong. A job in which required well over 100 cubic yards of concrete&#44; 
				and a crew of ten.</p>

				<p>From poll-barns&#44; floors&#44; to patios we can handle almost anything that can be thrown at us. 
				And we can guarantee that you&#39;ll love the finished project.</p>
				
				
				<h2>How about <a href="decorative.html">Decorative</a> concrete?</h2>

				<p>We specialize in doing stamped concrete. There are a great variety of stamps to choose 
				from. We get most of our stamps and colors through <a href="http://kuert.com/">Kuert&#39;s Concrete</a>&#44; 
				whom order&#39;s them from <a href="https://www.butterfieldcolor.com/">Butterfield Color</a>. 
				<br>
				
				<p>In Milford&#44; we redid the flooring for The Turf&#44; a small local bar. The bar would 
				soon find itself with brand new flooring in some areas. To which we did a phenomenal 					
				job doing the stamped concrete for.</p>
				<h2>Looking to tear out existing concrete?</h2>
				<p>We have a variety of tools at our disposal for ripping out old&#44; cracked concrete. 
				This ranges from a Bobcat, jackhammers, to crowbars and sledgehammers (if it's really stubborn). 
				If you want just a single section taken out and redone, that's a feasible option! Although we 
				can't guarantee that we can get it out perfectly. This is because we don't know what what sort 
				of reinforcement (rebar, wire, etc.) was placed in the existing concrete. That won't stop us from
				attempting to get your pre-existing concrete out of where it's at. </p>
