				<h2>Gallery</h2>
				<p>These images are from job-sites in which we worked on from the Summer of 2016, to the 
				Spring of 2017. With each one, we took the utmost care in bringing them what they wanted.</p>
				<h3>Barbee Lake</h3>
				<figure class="barbee">

				</figure>
				<p>On this site, we took care of handling the steps and patio. We used flexible forms in 
				order to get a radius (curved edge). The steps were done in one kind of stamp, the inside 
				of the patio was done with a fieldstone, and the edging around the patio was done in a third 
				type of stamp. Inside of the edging we used multiple different colors in order to achieve 
				the pattern in which is shown. The edging itself was done with a dark smoke color. After 
				the steps had set-up a little bit, we removed the form and scrubbed it with a sponge in 
				order to get the desired texture for the sides and front. With curved steps, it's quite 
				difficult to remove the form as the concrete can break off.</p>
				<p>We were extra careful in making sure any concrete that splattered, was wiped off of the 
				siding and door. Once concrete dries on anything plastic, it's very, very difficult to get
				it off of the surface. To remove the concrete we simply use a washcloth soaked in water.</p>
				<p>We made sure that the yard outside of where the dirt had been placed was not disturbed.
				We took wall forms and laid them flat, so that we could run wheelbarrows over them without
				destroying the yard or grass. We like to make sure that the homeowners are happy with the 
				job that was done.</p>
				
				<h3 class="stant">Stanton Lake</h3>
				<p>First of all, where the rightmost, highest patio sits, we had to pour footers and a small wall
				in order to have a base to start this job. This required about a hundred and fifty feet of wooden 
				forms. After the footer and wall had set, we came in and graded the ground underneath where the 
				patio would set. The next step was to drill holes inside and out, and add rebar to the wall. More 
				reinforcement in the likes of a mesh wire would be included as well. This would mean that the 
				job-site was ready to pour. We used 2 x 12's to form up this section of the patio.</p>
				<p>Stamping this project was quite fun. The stamp used for this project was a brand new stamp. 
				"Ship Plank" is the name of this stamp. </p>
				<p>The owner had a smoke accent added to bring out the coloration of the ship plank stamp.</p>
				<p>While taking off the form to the lower section, part of the 2 inch overhang fell off. We were 
				able to put the section that broke off back to where it belonged.</p>

				<div class="war-text">
					<p>From a raggedy old bejeweled doorstep, to this beauty.</p>
					<p>This job-site required sanding off the top and side of the ratty material that was previously on 
					the porch. With our dust masks dawned, we took two hand-held concrete grinders and went to town.
					Three hours later we were looking at a smooth, yet porous surface. Before putting concrete down, 
					we had to put down a priming agent so that the concrete would stick and stay properly.</p>
					<p>We poured the interior stone looking area, before focusing on the edging. After getting the 
					concrete down, we waited an hour or two for it to stiffen up a bit before throwing a stamp down.
					As seen in the pictures, the owner chose a bluish, smoke accent in order to bring out the coloring
					within the stone stamp.</p>
					<p>The original brick steps, in which are in front of the door, remained. So to accent this, we
					decided we would mock this look, surrounding the edge of the patio with a look-alike brick. We used
					a brick stamp and brick coloring in order to get it to look as real as the brick steps. After stamping 
					on the brick pattern, we took paint brushes, and colored on the white, and brick colors to help make the
					brick pattern pop even further.</p>

				<h3 class="tippe">Lake Tippecanoe</h3>
				<figure class="tippecanoe">

				<p>How do you pour concrete in an area where it's really wet? <br> Pour it extra thick.</p>
				<p>Working around the lakes, you find a way to do your job, albeit working around water. This sidewalk 
				was placed in an area where it's constantly washed out whenever it rains in the slightest. In order to 
				compensate for that fact, we put extra reinforcement and poured the concrete at about five inches thick.
				A four inch tile was placed in certain spots to help the water to drain under the concrete, rather than 
				over.</p>
				<p>The stamp used for this job was a small plank. If one were to measure it, it'd be about three inches
				wide per plank. We had to be careful not to get any concrete unto the existing platform, or the steps 
				that we were pouring around. Anything that did splash unto the existing areas, was cleaned off quickly.</p>
				<p>On most stamp projects, we cut the concrete prior sealing it. The reason why we do this? Because the 
				sealer is really sticky. So if we were to cut it after sealing, it'd do more bad than good.</p>
				<p>This site received a smoke accent, as well. Smoke is one of the most common accent colors for doing
				stamped work. This is because it's a subtle color. It's not quite black, but not really light either. 
				It does the concrete justice in drawing out the lines of the stamp's grain.</p>
				<p>The first picture to the right depicts the sidewalk prior to receiving sealer. The second picture 
				shows the difference between what the sidewalk looks like prior to be sealed, and once it has been sealed.
				The third picture shows how much detail the sealer brings to the concrete.</p>
				
				
				<h3 class="barrington">Barrington Hills, Warsaw</h3>
				<figure class="barring">

				</figure>
				<p>A lot of time was spent on this site. A majority of the summer in fact. The house that stood on the property 
				had burned down. The only thing left was the foundation. Which would be quite helpful as we wouldn't have to add
				a whole basement foundation. But this doesn't mean we didn't put any concrete down before getting to the prettier
				parts of the job. While there was an existing foundation, we had to add on a few spots to it. This would include 
				column supports, as well as a short wall for the patio, and one for the garage area.</p>
				<p>After having the support areas up, we than moved onto pouring the garage floor. This would be quite simple
				to do as it was regular flat-work. We knocked this area out within a day.</p>
				<p>Next would come the patio, steps, and drive-way.</p>
				<p>The driveway wasn't anything different from a usual driveway. We used D-forms, and poured it at four inches 
				thick. The standard for a driveway. Besides two areas, in which we used a flex-form in order to get a radius</p>
				
				<p>The steps weren't as simple as they usually would be. We formed up the steps to how we thought the owner would
				like it, but he wasn't fond of how it looked. In a rare instance, we left him the supplies, and he formed it up to
				his specifications. It's worth mentioning that he's a former contractor, and has done concrete for his own projects,
				plenty of times. After he had them to his liking, we came in and poured them, with a one inch overhang. The top step
				would receive a stamp. This stamp was a Compass Rose, with distinct coloring.</p>
				<p>The patio required a few weeks of work in order to get it done. Before pouring the concrete we had to setup the 
				forms so that it was at a degree. This would help to wick water away. </p>
