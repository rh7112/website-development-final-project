				<h2>Decorative</h2>
				<p>We take pride in being one of the only concrete contractors in the area that do 
				stamped/decorative concrete. We&rsquo;ve narrowed down how to do this type of concrete to 
				a science. Our workers have even assisted other local contractors when they weren&rsquo;t 
				quite able to figure out how to do this type of concrete. The intricacies of doing 
				decorative concrete comes down to knowing the concrete very well&#44; that you're using 
				&#40;albeit from a truck&#44; or bag.&#41;</p>

				<h2>How we do Stamped Concrete</h2>
				<p>With these steps let&rsquo;s assume you're getting the concrete from the likes of 
				<a href="http://keurt.com">Kuert&rsquo;s</a> Concrete</p> 
				
				<h3>Before getting started</h3>

				<p>The one hiring us should specify weather they want the concrete to be colored all 
				the way through, or if they just want the top layer to be colored. In the former instance, 
				before even getting started&#44; the one ordering the concrete should specify that they&rsquo;d 
				like color within the concrete. This is quite common in stamped concrete&#44; even if it's a stone 
				pattern. One may even have to provide the bags of color to the company so that they can mix it 
				prior to arriving.</p>
				
				
				
				<p>In the instance the owner wants the color to be only on top, than the color will be placed 
				on top of the concrete after to pouring and setting-up. </p>
				

				
				<ol class="stamp-steps">
					<li>Pour it</li>
					<p>This is where stamped concrete doesn't vary from usual concrete. The concrete is laid 
					out according to the standards of how regular concrete is done. This is where we put 
					an edge to it&#44; float&#44; and trowel it down to get it as flat as possible. We then wait 
					until everything is hard except the top &frac12; &ndash; &frac14; inch.</p>
			
					<li>Stamp it</li>
					<p>Once the concrete is ready, if color wasn't applied to the concrete, this is the time to place 
					the powder evenly. Before putting mats down, a solution that smells of bubble-gum must be used to 
					make sure that the mat doesn't stick to the wet concrete. This solution also help the concrete to 
					take to the stamp itself. After all the color powder has been applied thoroughly, this is when 
					stamping can start. With four to seven mats per each stamp set, they must be rotated plenty of times. 
					After a mat or two has been placed down, they must be tamped in, in order to get the stamp to leave 
					an impression into the concrete.</p>
			
					<li class="seal-it">Seal it</li>
					<p>A few days after the concrete is completely done, this is when we come back and seal the concrete. 
					If the owner specified that only the top layer is colored, than we have to wash off excess powder on 
					top of the concrete. This can be done with a hose, water faucet, and a brush (as shown above to the 
					right). After we get this step done, it's ready for the next part. Before putting down the sealer 
					itself, we take water and mix it with the accent color specified so that it draws out the lines 
					within the concrete. We usually rub this into the concrete lightly so that it falls into all the 
					cracks and crevices. After this water solution dries, we can put on the sealer, which really makes 
					the coloring in the concrete pop. After letting the sealer sit for a few hours, it's now ready for use!</p>

					<li class="cut-it">Cut It</li>
					<p>Just like any other sort of <a href="flatwork.html">Flat-work</a>, concrete needs relief cuts. This 
					ensures that in the winter months, the concrete will be less likely to crack, but rather the small lines
					made by the saw, will give it a place to release that tension rather than just shatter all over. We have 
					a walk-behind concrete saw, that usually gives us pretty straight lines, or if we can't lug that over, we
					can even use our handheld concrete saw with a diamond blade in order to cut the concrete. Just like any 
					other slab, we usually cut lines either every four or eight foot. Depending on how big the slab is altogether.
					If it's twenty-one foot in length, we're not going to cut it at eight foot, otherwise it'll look disproportionate.
					Instead we'd cut these lines at seven foot to ensure that it's of equal length. And for stamped jobs
					we usually try to cut along a seam, as long as there is one. With most wood patterns, there's usually quite a 
					few lines. But as some stone patterns are rather jagged, we'll just cut at an even distance, rather than 
					try to snake through the pattern, as it probably wouldn't do the concrete any good to take that route anyways.</p>
