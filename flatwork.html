			   <p>Within late 2016-2017 we completed a great deal of driveways&#44; floors&#44; and patios. 
			   All of these fall into the same class as they require similar tools to complete each one.</p> 
			   <p>These images are from a drive-way at Barrington Hills in Warsaw&#44; Indiana. This job-site was previously just a foundation. We added on pillar supports, garage floor, driveway, patio, and steps. The owner was quite enthralled with the job we had done.</p>
			   <h2>Drive-ways</h2>
			   <p>One of the easiest things to manage is Drive-ways. These usually just require a D-form and cardboard material in
			   order to add a radius. D-form's are a four to five inch steel form that requires four steaks in order to hold it 
			   into place. Usually driveways contain a slope going away from the househould, barn, etc. So we use a laser level 
			   in order to make sure that there's a slight drop from form to form. 
			   <br> After pouring the concrete they require some maintenece. This includes floating the entire surface, 
			   usually with a bull-float, which is a float attached to a number of aluminum poles. Making it simple to make sure
			   the entire surface is flat. 
			   <br> From there, we float around the edges, and put in an edge around the outer-lying 
			   areas of the drive.</p>
			   <h2>Garage Floors</h2>
			   <p>Usually if a garage floor needs torn out, it'll take us a bit to get the job done, as we have to cut out the 
			   pre-exisitng, and haul it out. Usually getting it out of the garage area requires lifting the chunks out by hand. 
			   Nonetheless, we'll get it done! Once we're ready to pour some concrete, we usually have to put in a drain. This 
			   entails using our trusty ol' laser level to make sure the drain is approximately an inch lower than the outer-most
			   area of where the garage floor will be. This ensures that the water won't pool up on the sides, or in front of the 
			   door. We usually even tape the drain before ever putting down concrete, so that when we finish, it isn't full of concrete.
			   Whence we start pouring we usually work our way from the back wall, out. That way we aren't stepping in something
			   we've already done. After getting the concrete all laid out, we usually go back through, on sheets of foam, in order to 
			   float out everything from the drain, out to the walls. After the concrete is a bit harder, we can through on an 
			   electric trowel. It takes about an hour or two with the trowel in order to get the slick finish that most garage floors
			   have.</p>
			   <h2>Patios</h2>
			   <p>Patios are usually quite simple. Just as depicted in the video on our "<a href="about.html">About</a>" page, we follow
			   methods not any different than that company when it comes to handling patios. Just as they use plastic on the door-way in order
			   to ensure that no concrete splatters on the door, we do the same. In order to get the perfect result, we take our time in 
			   making sure that the concrete sets just right. This includes making sure we don't put an edge on it too early, as it'd just 
			   waste time because the concrete would refill in that edge when we go to float out anything close to the outside. We know just
			   when to put a float on the concrete, and when to use a trowel instead.</p>
			   <figure>

			   </figure>
			   <h2>Sidewalks</h2>
			   <p>Being as we serve the lakes area (Tippecanoe, Webster, Wawasee, etc.) we put in quite a few sidewalks or walkways that lead
			   to the lake, around the house itself. When it's not ideal to tote around D-forms we tend to just use a 2x4, or 2x6 in order to
			   get the desired height. Just like a D-form, we use stakes in order to hold up the form. But with a piece of wood, this requires 
			   that we nail the stake to it in order to get it to stay in place. We usually have to back-fill (put dirt on the stake-side) of 
			   the form a bit, as there tends to be a gap between the bottom of the form and the ground which would otherwise make the concrete 
			   flow right out of the bottom.</p>
			   <p>Sidewalks tend to be quite easy to do. We can usually have a sidewalk formed up and poured within a day or two, as they don't
			   require too much effort, or concrete.</p>
			   <h2>Steps</h2>
			   <p>While one wouldn't be able to tell just by looking at them, steps create quite a problem for concrete contractors. 
			   That's not to say we can't handle the problem, in fact, we enjoy taking on steps. Each step itself has to be a few inches
			   in height, with a 1/4 - 1/2 inch difference in slope from front to back. And if the owner wants a radius or stamp work
			   added unto the steps, that just adds to the fun!</p>
